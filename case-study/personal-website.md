## My Personal Website - A Case Study
#### *Who, what, when, how, and why I developed this.*

### Intro
My name is Eve, and I'm a recent University of California San Diego graduate originally from Austin, Texas. I got my BS in Mathematics - Computer Science and am looking for engineering roles in software, QA, and related fields. In the meantime, I thought I'd sharpen my web development skills and learn some new UI/UX skills through this project. I've always been interested in art and design, so I'm excited to explore how these interests intersect with my technical skills through this case study! 

### Problem
In such a saturated job market, it's essential to find a way to set yourself apart from other candidates. I know that I'm more than a resume stating my GPA, skills, and work experience, and I want to have something to show for it---something that helps viewers truly understand the person that I am behind the screen.
