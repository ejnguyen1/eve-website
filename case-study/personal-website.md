## My Personal Website - A Case Study
###### Who, what, when, how, and why I developed this.

### Intro
My name is Eve, and I'm a recent University of California San Diego graduate originally from Austin, Texas. I got my BS in Mathematics - Computer Science and am looking for engineering roles in software, QA, and related fields. In the meantime, I thought I'd sharpen my web development skills and learn some new UI/UX skills through this project. I've always been interested in art and design, so I'm excited to explore how these interests intersect with my technical skills through this case study!
